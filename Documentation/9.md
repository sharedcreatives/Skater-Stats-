1. **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.

2. **Player Service**: Manages player profiles, statistics, and related data.

3. **Team Service**: Handles team information, rosters, and management.

4. **Game Service**: Manages game schedules, results, and statistics.

5. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about game updates, player stats, etc.

6. **Gateway Service**: Serves as the API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices.

      User is developing a microservices architecture in Laravel with the following services:

7. **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
8. **Player Service**: Manages player profiles, statistics, and related data.
9. **Team Service**: Handles team information, rosters, and management.
10. **Game Service**: Manages game schedules, results, and statistics.
11. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about game updates, player stats, etc.
12. **Gateway Service**: Serves as the API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices.
   

### Step 1: Project Structure & Setup
We'll need to create a Laravel project for each service along with the **Gateway Service**. You can organize the projects like this:

```
/skater-stats-microservices
├── user-service
├── player-service
├── team-service
├── game-service
├── notification-service
└── gateway-service
```

### Step 2: Creating Each Laravel Service
For each service (User, Player, Team, Game, Notification, and Gateway), you'll create a new Laravel project. We'll use Laravel Sail to streamline the development environment with Docker.

#### Create Each Service:
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd skater-stats-microservices

# Create Laravel projects
composer create-project laravel/laravel user-service
composer create-project laravel/laravel player-service
composer create-project laravel/laravel team-service
composer create-project laravel/laravel game-service
composer create-project laravel/laravel notification-service
composer create-project laravel/laravel gateway-service
```

### Step 3: Configuring the `.env` Files
Each service will need to have its `.env` file configured to avoid port conflicts and to specify unique names for the databases.

Example configuration for each service's `.env`:
```env
APP_NAME=UserService
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:YOUR_APP_KEY
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:8001

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=user_service
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
```

Change the `APP_URL` and `DB_DATABASE` for each service:
- **User Service**: Port `8001`
- **Player Service**: Port `8002`
- **Team Service**: Port `8003`
- **Game Service**: Port `8004`
- **Notification Service**: Port `8005`
- **Gateway Service**: Port `8000`

### Step 4: Docker Configuration
We'll use Docker Compose to orchestrate our services. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  user-service:
    build:
      context: ./user-service
    container_name: user-service
    ports:
      - "8001:8000"
    env_file: ./user-service/.env
    volumes:
      - ./user-service:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - microservices-network

  player-service:
    build:
      context: ./player-service
    container_name: player-service
    ports:
      - "8002:8000"
    env_file: ./player-service/.env
    volumes:
      - ./player-service:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - microservices-network

  # Repeat for team, game, notification, and gateway services

networks:
  microservices-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### Step 5: Setting Up the Gateway Service
The **Gateway Service** will route all requests to the appropriate microservices using Laravel routes and HTTP clients.

1. Install the **Guzzle HTTP Client** in the `gateway-service`:
   ```bash
   cd gateway-service
   composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
   ```

2. Create the route file `routes/api.php`:
   ```php
   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;
   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

   Route::prefix('/users')->group(function () {
       Route::get('/', function () {
           $response = Http::get('http://user-service:8001/api/users');
           return $response->json();
       });
   });

   Route::prefix('/players')->group(function () {
       Route::get('/', function () {
           $response = Http::get('http://player-service:8002/api/players');
           return $response->json();
       });
   });
   ```

3. Update `gateway-service/.env` to allow cross-origin requests:
   ```env
   APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

   Install Laravel CORS package:
   ```bash
   composer require fruitcake/laravel-cors
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag="cors"
   ```

### Step 6: Running the Services
Now that everything is set up, run the services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- Each service should now be accessible at its respective port.
- The **Gateway Service** should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Step 7: Testing the Setup
To test if the routing works, you can send a request to the gateway:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/users
```

This should proxy the request to the `user-service` and return a response.
