"content": "Sure, let's start by defining the basic database schema for the **Team Service** in your Laravel microservice setup. Here's a suggested list of tables and fields you might need:\n\n### Teams Table\n- **id**: (Primary key) Unique identifier for each team (auto-incrementing integer).\n- **name**: (String) The name of the team (e.g., \"Maple Leafs\").\n- **city**: (String) The city the team is based in (e.g., \"Toronto\").\n- **logo**: (String) Path to the team's logo image.\n- **founded_year**: (Integer) The year the team was established.\n- **created_at**: (Timestamp) When the team entry was created.\n- **updated_at**: (Timestamp) When the team entry was last updated.\n\n### Rosters Table\nThis table will connect players to teams.\n- **id**: (Primary key) Unique identifier for each roster entry.\n- **team_id**: (Foreign key) References the `id` of the `teams` table.\n- **player_id**: (Foreign key) References the `id` of the players (likely managed by another service).\n- **position**: (String) Player position (e.g., \"Forward\").\n- **number**: (Integer) Player jersey number.\n- **created_at**: (Timestamp) When the roster entry was created.\n- **updated_at**: (Timestamp) When the roster entry was last updated.\n\n### Coaches Table\nIf you plan to store coaches related to teams, you can use a separate table.\n- **id**: (Primary key) Unique identifier for each coach.\n- **team_id**: (Foreign key) References the `id` of the `teams` table.\n- **name**: (String) Name of the coach.\n- **role**: (String) Role of the coach (e.g., \"Head Coach\").\n- **created_at**: (Timestamp) When the coach entry was created.\n- **updated_at**: (Timestamp) When the coach entry was last updated.\n\n### Relationships and Notes\n- You will need to define relationships between these tables in your Eloquent models. For example, the `Team` model will have a `hasMany` relationship with the `Rosters` and `Coaches` tables.\n- In terms of relationships:\n  - `Team` can have multiple players (`hasMany`).\n  - `Team` can have multiple coaches (`hasMany`).\n\n### Migration Example\nHere's a quick example of the `teams` migration file:\n\n```php\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Migrations\\Migration;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Schema\\Blueprint;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Schema;\n\nclass CreateTeamsTable extends Migration\n{\n    public function up()\n    {\n        Schema::create('teams', function (Blueprint $table) {\n            $table->id();\n            $table->string('name');\n            $table->string('city');\n            $table->string('logo')->nullable();\n            $table->integer('founded_year');\n            $table->timestamps();\n        });\n    }\n\n    public function down()\n    {\n        Schema::dropIfExists('teams');\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should give you a good foundation for your **Team Service**. You can expand this by adding additional fields or tables as your application needs grow."
